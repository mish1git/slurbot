# slurbot, ala how to make discord mods useless
A simple discord.py rewrite bot created to control slur usage, I created this bot for a server with a rampant slur problem at first, but then decided to upload the source code here. This can also be used as a cog for your existing Discord bot, just rename  @bot.event() to @commands.Cog.listener()

Big thanks to lukgth for helping me a lot, the help's really appreciated my dude.
